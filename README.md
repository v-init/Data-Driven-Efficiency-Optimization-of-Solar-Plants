# Data-Driven-Efficiency-Optimization-of-Solar-Plants

This repository contains code for analyzing and potentially predicting power generation data from solar plants. It includes functionality for:

1. Data Import: Read power generation and weather data from CSV files.

2. Database Creation: Create a non-normalized database using sqlite3 and populate it with raw data.

3.Data Normalization: Normalize the data by combining information from multiple plants and adding relevant metrics.

4. Data Exploration and Visualization: Explore and visualize the data using libraries like pandas and Matplotlib to gain deeper insights and identify patterns.

5. Machine Learning (Future Development): Implement machine learning models to predict future power generation and understand factors influencing it.
